This is a study project aimed at gaining practical experience at
working with the Spring Framework, designing and developing multi-component
systems.

## Note

This is the part of [PDFReader](https://github.com/he1ex-tG/PDFReader) project.

## Structure

This module provides an [API](#1-api) for saving files to the 
[database](#2-files-store) and extracting.

### 1. API

The API is built using the features provided by 
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). It provides some 
endpoints that can be used by third party services:

| __Method__ | __Endpoint__       | __Description__                                                                                               |
|------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET        | /                  | Get info                                                                                                      |
| GET        | /api/v1            | Get API info (e.g. request method, content type, incoming data format and data type that returns in response) |
| GET        | /api/v1/files      | Get a list of user files that is specified in the request parameter                                           |
| GET        | /api/v1/files/{id} | Get file by id                                                                                                |
| POST       | /api/v1/files      | Upload file                                                                                                   |

### 2. Files store

File storage is based on [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) 
project and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). String Data find in 
project files all [entities](#21-entities) and rebuild database structure 
accordingly.
> __Note__
> 
> By default, database cleared and rebuild structure on each project restart. 
> It can be configured by changing corresponding parameter in 
> `application.yaml`

Entities are used by [repositories](#23-repositories) to exchange data with 
database. For reduce traffic and performance increase used lightweight 
[DTOs](#22-dto) instead entire entities. DTOs also used by [API](#1-api) in 
some responses. Project logic is placed in [service](#24-service) layer.

#### 2.1. Entities

There is just one entity - ConverterFile. It's enough for achievement of the 
project goals. Class ConverterFile contains field that describe uploaded file.

Specified for each file:

    var fileName: String,
    @Lob val file: ByteArray,
    var converterUser: String,

Autogenerated:

    var timestamp: Timestamp = Timestamp.valueOf(LocalDateTime.now()),
    @Id @GeneratedValue var id: Long? = null,

#### 2.2. DTO

Using DTOs is not necessarily, but it's good practice, I guess. 

In early editions
(without DTO) [entities](#21-entities) from the database were passed in their 
entirety to the consumer on any request. 

#### 2.3. Repositories

    com.he1extg.converterdata.repository

#### 2.4. Service

Service layer is layer between [API](#1-api) controller and 
[repository](#23-repositories). Its role is file limit control for each user.
Yes, very simple, but necessary.

### 3. Tests

Functional tests are located in `./src/test` directory.

## Build Instructions

Execute from command line (in project root directory)

    # ./gradlew bootJar

or manually run build task `bootJar` from IDE. 

The compiled Jar is in `./build/libs/ConverterAPI-[version]-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

## Usage

Here:
- [host] is the host where the project is running, [host] = `localhost` by 
default.
- [port] is the port. It can be changed in the `application.yaml` settings 
file. [port] = `8081` by default.

Remember that the controller returns a DTO. So it's impossible to save a byte 
array from database to a file directly.

Get file list for user:



    # curl http://[host]:[port]/api/v1/files?user=SuperUser

Upload file:



    # curl -F file=@C:/hw.mp3 -F user=SuperUser http://[host]:[port]/api/v1/files

Download file:


    # curl http://[host]:[port]/api/v1/files/1
