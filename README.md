This is a study project aimed at gaining practical experience at
working with the Spring Framework, designing and developing multi-component
systems.

## Note

This is the part of [PDFReader](https://github.com/he1ex-tG/PDFReader) project.

## Structure

This module provides an [API](#1-api) for saving files to the 
[database](#2-files-store) and extracting. First interoperate with second 
over the [service](#3-service) layer.

### 1. API

The API is built using the features provided by 
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). It provides some 
endpoints that can be used by third party services:

| __Method__ | __Endpoint__       | __Description__                                                                                               |
|------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET        | /                  | Get info                                                                                                      |
| GET        | /api/v1            | Get API info (e.g. request method, content type, incoming data format and data type that returns in response) |
| GET        | /api/v1/files      | Get a list of user files that is specified in the request parameter                                           |
| GET        | /api/v1/files/{id} | Get file by id                                                                                                |
| POST       | /api/v1/files      | Upload file                                                                                                   |

### 2. Files store

File storage is based on [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) 
project and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). 

Spring Data find in project files all [entities](#21-entities) and build 
database structure accordingly.
> __Note__
> 
> By default, database erase all data and rebuild structure on each project 
> restart. It can be configured by changing corresponding parameter in 
> `application.yaml` or passing it by another way.

Entities are used by [repositories](#23-repositories) to exchange data with 
database. For reduce traffic and performance increase used lightweight 
[DTOs](#22-dto) instead entire entities. DTOs also used by [API](#1-api) in 
some responses. Project logic is placed in [service](#24-service) layer.

#### 2.1. Entities

There is just one entity - ConverterFile. It's enough for achievement of the 
project goals. Class ConverterFile contains field that describe uploaded file.

Specified for each file:

    var fileName: String,
    @Lob val file: ByteArray,
    var converterUser: String,

Autogenerated:

    var timestamp: Timestamp = Timestamp.valueOf(LocalDateTime.now()),
    @Id @GeneratedValue var id: Long? = null,

Field `converterUser` have type `String`. But in future this information might be 
moved to independent entity.

#### 2.2. DTO

Using DTOs is not necessarily, but it's good practice, I guess. 

In early editions (without DTO) [entities](#21-entities) from the database 
were passed in their entirety to the consumer on any request. It was redundant. 

Now there are DTOs:

  `FilenameBytearrayDTO` - contains file name and body of file. It used when 
consumer requests the file;

  `IdFilenameDTO` - this and next DTO have no file body. It's used to provide to
consumer information about files that stored by user.

  `IdTimestampDTO` - used to control the files amount (and it's main purpose of 
poor [service](#24-service) layer).

The first two DTOs are in the form of classes, the last one is in the form of 
an interface. SpringData automatically implements the interface into a wrapper 
class and populates it with data from the database. This is convenient to use 
when actions with the interface are performed inside this module. But there 
may be problems with their interpretation on the recipient's side. Therefore, 
the DTOs that are used in responses to the consumer are classes. The 
[repositories](#23-repositories) section has examples of using of both classes 
and interfaces. Still, this project is educational, as mentioned earlier.

#### 2.3. Repositories

Repository class implements CrudRepository interface. It allows to auto create 
methods that are needed. But also it's possible to define queries directly. Both 
approaches are presents in the code. For instance,

    /**
     * Using custom query and class DTO
     */
    @Query("select new com.he1extg.converterdata.dto.converterfile.IdFilenameDTO(c.id, c.fileName) from ConverterFile c where c.converterUser = :converterUser")
    fun getConverterFileListByConverterUser(
        @Param("converterUser") converterUser: String
    ): List<IdFilenameDTO>

and

    /**
     * Using auto built query and interface DTO
     * Query looks like this: @Query("select c.id as id, c.timestamp as timestamp from ConverterFile c where c.converterUser = :converterUser")
     */
    fun getConverterFileTimestampByConverterUser(converterUser: String): List<IdTimestampDTO>

Even though the repository class based on ConverterFile [entity](#21-entities), 
it returns [DTOs](#22-dto) as responses on queries. The main benefit of this 
is that byte arrays of stored files do not transfer to consumer when it 
requests only ids and filenames, for example. It reduces traffic and increases 
entire performance.

Repositories are used on [service](#3-service) layer.

### 3. Service

In this module, the service layer is quite simple. But its presence is necessary
to build a clean architecture, I guess. It serves to access the 
[database](#23-repositories) and pass the results to the [controller](#1-api). 
The only complication is the implementation of the function to control the 
maximum number of files uploaded by the user.

### 4. Tests

Functional tests are located in `./src/test` directory.

## Build Instructions

Execute from command line (in project root directory)

    # ./gradlew bootJar

or manually run build task `bootJar` from IDE. 

The compiled Jar is in `./build/libs/ConverterAPI-[version]-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

## Usage

Here:
- [host] is the host where the project is running, [host] = `localhost` by 
default.
- [port] is the port. It can be changed in the `application.yaml` settings 
file. [port] = `8081` by default.

Remember that the controller returns a DTO. So it's impossible to save a byte 
array from database to a file directly.

Get file list for user:



    # curl http://[host]:[port]/api/v1/files?user=SuperUser

Upload file:



    # curl -F file=@C:/hw.mp3 -F user=SuperUser http://[host]:[port]/api/v1/files

Download file:


    # curl http://[host]:[port]/api/v1/files/1
